\subsubsection{CMS Spread Option, Capped/Floored CMS Spread}
\label{pricing:ir_cmsspreadoption}

European CMS Spread Options (or Caps/Floors on CMS Spreads) are priced using 
the Log-normal Swap rate Model 
(LSM) (see section \ref{models:LSM}). This model supports log-normal swap rate 
dynamics and has been extended to support shifted log-normal and normal dynamics 
as well, see (Caspers, 2015).
