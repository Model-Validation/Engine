\subsubsection{Digital CMS Spread Option}
\label{pricing:ir_digitalcmsspreadoption}

Similar to CMS Spread Options, Digital CMS Spread Options are priced using the
Log-normal Swap rate Model (LSM) (see section \ref{models:LSM}), while the
digital coupon payoffs in the underlying CMS swap are replicated using the
call/put option spreads.
